## 🔬 About Me

I'm a microbiology student at BYU graduating in April 2026 with a passion for **oncolytic virotherapy** and translational cancer research. My goal is to bridge the gap between clinical diagnostics, computational biology, and cutting-edge cancer immunotherapy research to help develop more effective treatments for cancer patients.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔭 I'm currently working on

-   **Finishing my BS in Microbiology** at BYU (graduating April 2026)
-   **Undergraduate research** in immunology, virology, and molecular biology (MMBIO 294R, 399R, CHEM 297R)
-   Building expertise in **flow cytometry** and immunology lab techniques
-   Completing key courses: **Hematology**, **Immunology Lab**, and **Bioinformatics**
-   Planning my transition to a **biotech industry** role in Utah

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌱 I'm currently learning

-   **Cancer biology & immunology** - Reading Nature Immunology, Nature Cancer, and key textbooks like *Oncoimmunology*
-   **Python & R programming** for genomic data science - through online courses and personal projects
-   **Bioinformatics fundamentals** - preparing for future computational cancer research
-   **Organic chemistry & biochemistry** - strengthening prerequisites for PhD programs
-   **Data science & machine learning** - building computational skills to complement wet lab expertise

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on

-   **Research projects** in virology, immunology, or cancer biology
-   **Open-source bioinformatics tools** for genomic data analysis
-   **Cancer research initiatives** that bridge computational and experimental approaches
-   **Educational resources** for students pursuing non-traditional paths to PhD programs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🤔 I'm looking for help with

-   **Networking with scientists** working in oncolytic virotherapy or cancer immunology
-   **Advice on PhD applications** from people who took non-traditional paths (industry experience before PhD)
-   **Bioinformatics project ideas** that could strengthen my computational biology skills
-   **Mentorship** from translational scientists who bridge clinical and research worlds

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💬 Ask me about

-   **Career planning** for non-traditional paths to PhD programs
-   **Balancing work and graduate school** (I'll be doing MS part-time while working full-time!)
-   **Biotech industry experience** as a foundation for translational research
-   **Oncolytic virotherapy** and cancer immunology (my passion!)
-   **Flow cytometry** and immunology lab techniques
-   **Building a sustainable timeline** for long-term academic/career goals

## ⚡ Fun facts

-   🔬 I'm building a **clinical-computational-research triple threat** skillset that very few scientists have
-   🌱 I'm passionate about **mentoring students from non-traditional backgrounds** who want to pursue research careers
-   🍳 I enjoy **cooking** (with or without recipes), **reading** and **hiking** in my free time!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧬 My Unique Approach

Most PhD candidates choose one of these paths: - **Traditional route**: BS → PhD directly (age 22-28) - **Clinical route**: BS → clinical work → maybe PhD later - **Computational route**: BS → MS in Bioinformatics → PhD

**My hybrid approach**: - **BS Microbiology** → **Biotech Industry Work** → **MS Data Science** (while working) → **PhD in Oncolytic Virotherapy** → **Industry R&D Leadership + Adjunct Teaching**

This gives me industry biotech expertise, computational biology skills, AND research training - the perfect combination for developing therapies that actually make it from the bench to the bedside! 🚀
