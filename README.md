## 🔬 About Me

I'm a microbiology student at BYU graduating in April 2026 with a passion for **oncolytic virotherapy** and translational cancer research. My goal is to bridge the gap between clinical diagnostics, computational biology, and cutting-edge cancer immunotherapy research to help develop more effective treatments for cancer patients.

---

## 🔭 I'm currently working on

- **Finishing my BS in Microbiology** at BYU (graduating April 2026)
- **Undergraduate research** in immunology, virology, and molecular biology (MMBIO 294R, 399R, CHEM 297R)
- Building expertise in **flow cytometry** and immunology lab techniques
- Completing key courses: **Hematology**, **Immunology Lab**, and **Bioinformatics**
- Planning my transition to a **Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS)** role in Utah

---

## 🌱 I'm currently learning

- **Cancer biology & immunology** - Reading Nature Immunology, Nature Cancer, and key textbooks like *Oncoimmunology*
- **Python & R programming** for genomic data science (Coursera specializations)
- **Bioinformatics fundamentals** - preparing for future computational cancer research
- **Organic chemistry & biochemistry** - strengthening prerequisites for PhD programs
- **Data science & machine learning** - building computational skills to complement wet lab expertise

---

## 🎯 My Career Journey

I'm on a unique path combining **clinical laboratory science**, **data science**, and **translational research**:

1. **Phase 1 (2026-2027)**: Work as MLS while completing chemistry prerequisites and professional certifications (Phlebotomy CPT, BLS, AMT MLS)
2. **Phase 2 (2028-2029)**: Pursue **MS in Data Science** at University of Pittsburgh (part-time) while continuing MLS work - focusing on cancer genomics and computational biology
3. **Phase 3 (2030)**: Apply to **PhD programs** in Cancer Biology/Virology/Immunology at institutions like Mayo Clinic, University of Pittsburgh, City of Hope, and Utah/Huntsman Cancer Institute
4. **Phase 4 (2030-2035/36)**: Complete **PhD focused on oncolytic virotherapy** - engineering viruses to target and destroy cancer cells
5. **Phase 5 (2036+)**: Lead **oncolytic virus R&D programs** in biotech/pharma while teaching as an **adjunct professor**

## ⚡ Fun facts

- 🎓 I'll hold **4 professional certifications** by age 28: AMT MLS, Phlebotomy CPT, BLS, and First Aid
- 🔬 I'm building a **clinical-computational-research triple threat** skillset that very few scientists have
- 📊 I created an **interactive Jupyter notebook** to visualize and track my entire 10-year career roadmap with adjustable timelines and financial projections
- 🧘 I believe **sustainability > speed** - my roadmap includes detailed self-care strategies because burnout prevention is just as important as academic excellence
- 🎯 By the time I finish my PhD, I'll have **~4 years of clinical MLS experience** + **MS in Data Science** + **research expertise** - positioning me uniquely for translational oncolytic virus research
- 🌱 I'm passionate about **mentoring students from non-traditional backgrounds** who want to pursue research careers

## 🧬 My Unique Approach

Most PhD candidates choose one of these paths:
- **Traditional route**: BS → PhD directly (age 22-28)
- **Clinical route**: BS → clinical work → maybe PhD later
- **Computational route**: BS → MS in Bioinformatics → PhD

**My hybrid approach**: 
- **BS Microbiology** → **MLS work + Chemistry prerequisites** → **MS Data Science** (while working) → **PhD in Oncolytic Virotherapy** → **Industry R&D Leadership + Adjunct Teaching**

This gives me clinical diagnostic expertise, computational biology skills, AND research training - the perfect combination for developing therapies that actually make it from the bench to the bedside! 🚀
