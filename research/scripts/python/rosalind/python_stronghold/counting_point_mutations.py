# Problem 5: Counting and comparing point mutations in a homologous sequence of DNA

# Pseudocode:
'''
1. Open the file, read the lines for the two homologous DNA sequences and store the nucleotides of each DNA sequence 
2. Compare the nucleotides of each DNA sequence to mark any difference between them
3. Count the number of different nucleotides between the DNA sequences and store it as Hamming distance
4. Print the Hamming distance
''' 
# Program: 
dna_seq = [] # Empty list for dna sequence
hamming_distance = 0 # Hamming distance set to 0 to be added to

with open("rosalind_hamm.txt") as point_mutations: # opens the file
    for line in point_mutations: # Reads it line by line
        dna_seq.append(line.strip()) # Adds the lines to the list individually
seq1 = dna_seq[0] # The first DNA sequence is at the 0 index
seq2 = dna_seq[1] # The next DNA sequence is at the 1 index
    
for i in range(len(seq1)): # Loops through the nucleotides in seq1
    if seq1[i] != seq2[i]: # If the nucleotides is not the same as the homologous nucleotide in seq2
        hamming_distance += 1 # Hamming distance increases by 1
