    "- Accept 3.7-3.8 GPA is excellent\n",
    "- **Warning signs**: Chronic exhaustion, frequent illness, loss of interest\n",
    "- **Emergency adjustment**: Extend MS to 2.5 years if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 3 (2029-2030): PhD Applications**\n",
    "- Set boundaries: 2-3 hours/day on apps max\n",
