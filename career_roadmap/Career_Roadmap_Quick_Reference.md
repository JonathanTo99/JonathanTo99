-   **Mental health**: Use counseling proactively

### Phase-Specific Strategies

**Phase 1 (2026-2027): Lab Work + Prerequisites** - Predictable 9-5 schedule = evenings free for study - Take 1 week off between Ochem 1 and Biochemistry - Quarterly check-in: Am I sleeping well? Is this pace sustainable?

**Phase 2 (2028-2029): MS + Work** - Use PTO strategically for finals/capstone - Accept 3.7 GPA is excellent - Consider extending MS to 2.5 years if needed

**Phase 3 (2029-2030): PhD Applications** - Set boundaries: 2-3 hours/day on apps max - Lab culture \> prestige when selecting programs - Consider gap time before PhD to recharge

**Phase 4 (2030-2035/36): PhD** - Set sustainable boundaries early - Regular therapy, maintain hobbies - Protect dissertation writing time

### Support Resources

-   University counseling (free for students)
-   National Suicide Prevention: 988
-   Crisis Text Line: HOME to 741741

### Remember

**Your timeline is a plan, not a prison.** Extending any phase by 6 months won't derail goals. Burning out is irreversible.
