# Hi, I'm Jonathan To 👋

## Computational Biologist & Proteomics Data Analyst

> **"Bridging the gap between High-Throughput Mass Spectrometry and Computational Automation."**

I am a hybrid wet/dry lab researcher currently engineering the Python infrastructure for the **BYU Mass Spectrometry Core**. My focus is on **Industrializing Biology**: transforming manual, error-prone assays into robust, reproducible data engines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Engineering Impact (Current Role)

-   **10x Throughput:** Architected Python pipelines (Pandas/NumPy) for the **Orbitrap Astral**, scaling daily capacity from 15 to **100+ proteomes**.
-   **85% QC Reduction:** Built programmatic visualization modules to automate instrument performance monitoring, removing manual validation bottlenecks.
-   **Precision at Scale:** Validated complex 3-species libraries (HeLa, E. coli, Yeast) identifying **11,000+ protein groups** with \<7% CV.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Technical Stack

| Domain | Tools |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| **Pipeline Engineering** | Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Git & GitHub |
| **Proteomics** | FragPipe, DIA-NN, Proteome Discoverer, Orbitrap Astral |
| **Data Science** | Jupyter, Scanpy, Pyteomics, SciKit-Learn |
| **Wet Lab** | Mass Spectrometry, Mammalian Cell Culture, High-Throughput Screening (HTS), Flow Cytometry |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Production Architecture

-   [**BYU-MS-Core-Automative-Proteomics-Tools**](https://github.com/MSCoreLab/BYU-MS-Core-Automative-Proteomics-Tools) (Live Production Code)
    -   **Overview:** The active OS powering the BYU Mass Spectrometry Core.
    -   **Tech:** Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
    -   **Key Metrics:**
        -   **10x Throughput:** Enabled scaling from 15 to **100+ proteomes/day**.
        -   **85% Efficiency Gain:** Reduced manual QC time by automating extraction workflows.
        -   **Data Integrity:** Ensured \<20% CV validation across multi-lab studies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Career Roadmap

I am pursuing a **hybrid wet/dry lab trajectory** designed to bridge the gap between bench science and data engineering.

-   **Phase 1 (Current):** Build high-throughput automation expertise in **Biotech Industry** (Recursion/TechBio).
-   **Phase 2 (Concurrent):** Complete **MS in Translational Bioinformatics** to formalize computational skills without leaving the workforce.
-   **Phase 3 (Future):** Pursue **PhD in Oncolytic Virotherapy** with a focus on industrial-grade translational research.

**Goal:** To combine industrial operational excellence with rigorous academic research training—ensuring therapies survive the transition from bench to bedside.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I'm looking to collaborate on

-   **Research projects** in virology, immunology, or cancer biology
-   **Open-source bioinformatics tools** for genomic data analysis
-   **Cancer research initiatives** that bridge computational and experimental approaches
-   **Educational resources** for students pursuing non-traditional paths to PhD programs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I'm looking for help with

-   **Networking with scientists** working in oncolytic virotherapy or cancer immunology
-   **Advice on PhD applications** from people who took non-traditional paths (industry experience before PhD)
-   **Mentorship** from translational scientists who bridge clinical and research worlds

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ask me about

-   **Career planning** for non-traditional paths to PhD programs
-   **Balancing work and graduate school** (I'll be doing MS part-time while working full-time!)
-   **Biotech industry experience** as a foundation for translational research
-   **Oncolytic virotherapy** and cancer immunology (my passion!)
-   **Flow cytometry** and immunology lab techniques
-   **Building a sustainable timeline** for long-term academic/career goals

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Fun facts

-   I'm building a **clinical-computational-research triple threat** skill set that is in high demand across disciplines
-   I'm passionate about **mentoring students from non-traditional backgrounds** who want to pursue research careers
-   I enjoy **cooking** (with or without recipes), **gaming**, **reading** and **hiking** in my free time!
