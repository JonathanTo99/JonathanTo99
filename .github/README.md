# Hi, I'm Jonathan To 👋

## Computational Biologist & Proteomics Data Analyst

> **"Bridging the gap between High-Throughput Mass Spectrometry and Computational Automation."**

I am a hybrid wet/dry lab researcher currently engineering the Python infrastructure for the **BYU Mass Spectrometry Core**. My focus is on **Industrializing Biology**: transforming manual, error-prone assays into robust, reproducible data engines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Engineering Impact (Current Role)

-   **10x Throughput:** Architected Python pipelines (Pandas/NumPy) for the **Orbitrap Astral**, scaling daily capacity from 15 to **100+ proteomes**.
-   **85% QC Reduction:** Built programmatic visualization modules to automate instrument performance monitoring, removing manual validation bottlenecks.
-   **Precision at Scale:** Validated complex 3-species libraries (HeLa, E. coli, Yeast) identifying **11,000+ protein groups** with \<7% CV.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Technical Stack

| Domain | Tools |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| **Pipeline Engineering** | Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), GitHub Actions, SQL |
| **Proteomics** | FragPipe, DIA-NN, Proteome Discoverer, Orbitrap Astral |
| **Data Science** | Jupyter, R (ggplot2), Scanpy, SciKit-Learn |
| **Wet Lab** | Mammalian Cell Culture, High-Throughput Screening (HTS), Flow Cytometry |

### Production Architecture

* **[Proteomics-Pipeline-Automation](https://github.com/YourUsername/BYU-Core-MS-Lab)** (Live Production Code)
    * **Overview:** This repository contains the production source code for the automation pipelines used at the **BYU Fritz B. Burns Cancer Research Center MS Core Facility**. *It is The active OS powering the BYU Mass Spectrometry Core.*
    * **Tech:** Flask, Pandas, Matplotlib, React.
    * **Key Performance Metrics:**
      * **10x Throughput:** Enabled scaling from 15 to **100+ proteomes/day** via automated batch processing.
      * **85% Efficiency Gain:** Reduced manual QC time by automating tic/mzML extraction and reporting.
      * **Data Integrity:** Implemented spike-in validation workflows (HeLa/E.coli/Yeast) to ensure <20% CV across multi-lab studies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I'm currently learning

-   **Organic chemistry & biochemistry** - strengthening prerequisites for PhD programs
-   **Cancer biology & immunology** - Reading Nature Immunology, Nature Cancer, and key textbooks like *Oncoimmunology*
-   **Python & R programming** for genomic data science - through online courses and personal projects
-   **Data science & machine learning** - building computational skills to complement wet lab expertise

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I'm looking to collaborate on

-   **Research projects** in virology, immunology, or cancer biology
-   **Open-source bioinformatics tools** for genomic data analysis
-   **Cancer research initiatives** that bridge computational and experimental approaches
-   **Educational resources** for students pursuing non-traditional paths to PhD programs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I'm looking for help with

-   **Networking with scientists** working in oncolytic virotherapy or cancer immunology
-   **Advice on PhD applications** from people who took non-traditional paths (industry experience before PhD)
-   **Bioinformatics project ideas** that could strengthen my computational biology skills
-   **Mentorship** from translational scientists who bridge clinical and research worlds

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ask me about

-   **Career planning** for non-traditional paths to PhD programs
-   **Balancing work and graduate school** (I'll be doing MS part-time while working full-time!)
-   **Biotech industry experience** as a foundation for translational research
-   **Oncolytic virotherapy** and cancer immunology (my passion!)
-   **Flow cytometry** and immunology lab techniques
-   **Building a sustainable timeline** for long-term academic/career goals

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Fun facts

-   🔬 I'm building a **clinical-computational-research triple threat** skillset that very few scientists have
-   🌱 I'm passionate about **mentoring students from non-traditional backgrounds** who want to pursue research careers
-   🍳 I enjoy **cooking** (with or without recipes), **gaming**, **reading** and **hiking** in my free time!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## My Unique Approach

Most PhD candidates choose one of these paths: - **Traditional route**: BS → PhD directly (age 22-28) - **Clinical route**: BS → clinical work → maybe PhD later - **Computational route**: BS → MS in Bioinformatics → PhD

**My hybrid approach**: - **BS Microbiology** → **Biotech Industry Work** → **MS in Translational Bioinformatics** (while working) → **PhD in Oncolytic Virotherapy** → **Industry R&D Leadership + Adjunct Teaching**

This gives me industry biotech expertise, computational biology skills, AND research training - the perfect combination for developing therapies that actually make it from the bench to the bedside! 🚀

I'm planting my tree now at age 26, and I'm excited to see it grow into a career advancing oncolytic virotherapy research! 🌳🔬
